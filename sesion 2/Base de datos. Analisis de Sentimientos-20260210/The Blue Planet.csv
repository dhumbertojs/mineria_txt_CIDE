1,1,Ocean World,12 Sep. 2001,8.2,"The ocean's influence dominates the world's weather systems and supports an enormous range of life. This first episode demonstrates the sheer scale, power and complexity of the ""Blue Planet""."
1,2,The Deep,19 Sep. 2001,8.5,"The deep sea, which gets darker with increasing depth until no more sunlight penetrates at about a kilometer depth, and ever colder closer to the bottom of the ocean, covers most of the planet and is thus by far the largest habitat on earth, yet has been explored less than space, so most scientific expeditions, at depths requiring modern submarine technology, discover at least one new species, or even whole new branches of submarine life. Like everywhere else, evolution has over millions of years produced several amazing adaptations to even the most extreme conditions..."
1,3,Open Ocean,26 Sep. 2001,8.0,"Endless blue stretches in every direction. The sea bed is a staggering eight kilometers deeper down and the nearest island is 500 kilometers away. There is nothing save the burning sun above and the blackened abyss below. How, then, does life exist?"

1,7,Tidal Seas,24 Oct. 2001,8.0,"Tidal marshes are one of the most productive parts of the world. Numerous plants support numerous animals, yet life is not easy: predators are attracted to these enormous quantities of food, forcing animals to seek constant protection from attack."

1,9,Deep Trouble,28 Oct. 2001,7.6,"For years man has ploughed the ocean in search of food and riches, but now we may be about to use this valuable asset, such is the intolerable strain we have inflicted. Deep Trouble is presented by Martha Holmes."
